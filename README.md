# Put In
**Put In** is a game where you have to deal as much damage as possible to a dummy. For this, the game has a system of "building" a wide variety of traps:
+ A circular saw is the simplest tool. It can be installed at any point on the map.
+ Spikes are placed only on the top of the map.
+ Knives should be placed only on the left or right side.
+ Mina puts herself on the floor. It is a disposable tool. Disappears after detonation.
+ Boomerang can be placed in any part of the map. It will fly from side to side. He changes sides when he collides with any object, except the player.
+ The rocket is placed on the bottom of the map. She shoots a beam upwards. If this beam crosses the dummy, it will start. It is a disposable item. Upon collision with any object, it detonates. Disappears after detonation.
+ A box with fireworks is placed at the bottom of the map. After placement, fireworks begin to fly out of the box in different directions. They, in turn, detonate upon collision with any object. After several fireworks are released, the box disappears.
+ Bayraktar, when activated, stops the plane for a few seconds.

And the game can be lost if the dummy catches the rescue plane. It has some behavioral features:
+ The plane is heading to the dummy by the shortest route.
+ If there is an obstacle on his way, he will try to bypass it.
+ If it is not possible to bypass the obstacle, the plane will shoot at it and destroy it.

Each weapon has its own strength scale. After it ends, the tool breaks and disappears. To reveal a new item, you must cross a specified score value. In order to display an item in a game session, you need to collect the required amount of session coins.
